# Sauce Engine

Sauce Engine is an open-source physics engine written in C#. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for simulating physics in 2D and 3D environments. Whether you're building games, simulations, or other applications that require realistic physics interactions, Sauce Engine is designed to empower your development.

## Features

- **2D and 3D Physics:** Simulate physics in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional spaces.
  
- **Rigid Body Dynamics:** Handle rigid body dynamics for realistic object interactions.

- **Collision Detection:** Efficient collision detection algorithms to handle complex interactions.

- **Extensibility:** Easily extend the engine with custom physics behaviors and integrations.

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation to help you get started and make the most of Sauce Engine.

## Getting Started

To start using Sauce Engine in your C# project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sauce-engine.git
   ```

2. Include the Sauce Engine library in your project.

3. Explore the examples and documentation to understand how to integrate and use the engine in your applications.

## Usage Example

```csharp
using SauceEngine;

// Create a new physics world
var world = new PhysicsWorld();

// Create a rigid body
var rigidBody = new RigidBody();

// Add the rigid body to the world
world.AddRigidBody(rigidBody);

// Simulate the physics
world.Simulate(deltaTime);
```
